#With the new ipmi backend, we only use the root-ssh console when the SUT boot up,
#and no longer setup the real serial console for either kvm or xen.
#When needs reboot, we will switch back to sut console which relies on ipmi.
#We will mostly rely on ikvm to continue the test flow.
#TODO: we need the serial output to debug issues in reboot, coolo will help add it.

#use it after SUT boot finish, as it requires ssh connection to SUT to interact with SUT, including window and serial console
